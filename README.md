# OPS
A series of projects for the OPS program by IEEE at UCLA. 
Projects include:

BlinkingLights:
A classic beginner project. The title says it all.

BlinkingLedPot:
A potentiometer controls the rate at which the LED blinks.

IRSensor:
As two IR sensors get closer or farther from each other, an LED will get brighter or dimmer. 

RedLightGreenLight:
A game where we programmed in one arduino for a red or green light to randomly light up, wait for a response (a corresponding button press) by wireless serial communication from another arduino, and repeat the pattern until the player pressing the buttons loses.

Rat:
The capstone project where we built (in teams) a gyroscope controlled rat-bot to race through a maze using two arduinos, radios, and servoes.
